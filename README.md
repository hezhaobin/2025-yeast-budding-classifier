[Frannie Murphy](https://www.binhe-lab.org/members/frannie-murphy/) made an ImageJ macro for automatically identifying yeast cells from microscopy images. The goal of this project is to predict the budding status of each cell using morphometric traits. The labeled data comes from Frannie, who manually classified yeast cells as "budded" or "unbudded", and used the ImageJ Macro she built to extract the morphometric traits. We will explore a number of ML models to find the best classisifier.
